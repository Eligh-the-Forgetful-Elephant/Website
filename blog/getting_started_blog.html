        <h1>🚀 Getting Started with Cybersecurity Research</h1>
        <div class="post-date">2025-06-10</div>
        
        <div class="content">
            <p>Welcome to my cybersecurity research blog. Here I'll be sharing my journey through malware analysis, penetration testing, and various security tools and techniques. I've really wanted to start a blog for a while now, but I've never had spent the time on it. Well, now i have. Here's my first post. I guess it would make good practice for me to write about my projects and thoughts.</p>

            <p>Today we'll talk about my First project, The Hackwave-Havoc Community page, and how I will be using it to host my friends from the rave scene. Hopefully I can get some more people to join the community and make it a fun place to find these artists content. I guess a thought behind this project is a desire to have a page to send people to see the scheduled shows coming up, the peeps online streaming content, and ultimately have a place to find the artists content. While this page specifically is for the rave scene, I'm basically just using it as a template for other pages I want to make going forward.</p>

            <div class="section-title">My Life Has Been a Waste of Time, I've got a black hole in my mind.</div>
            <p>There's something fascinating about understanding how computer systems work, how they can be used, and how you can break them.</p>

            <p>I've spent some time reading into malware analysis, reverse engineering, and penetration testing. It's not just about breaking things - it's about understanding the underlying mechanisms, the patterns, the psychology behind why they work. Growing up with gaming systems like the Gameboy Color and the PS1, I had learned early on how special our technology is, I mean running around a virtual world and having the power to control it with my decisions, and even exploit the systems that allowed you in that world. Simple things had big effects. I personally used these simple things to make my life easier, but at the time i had no idea how far I could go. Now that I've spent time with the technology around me now, I can see how far it can take me. Imagine I explored the programming then, I could of created my own pokemon, added modifications to the games, or even hacked further than the simple ones allowed.
            Anyways, I've now used this time with technology to make a new webpage. Let me know what you think.
            </p>

            <div class="section-title">The Hackwave-Havoc Community</div>
            <p>Spent most of today working on the Hackwave Havoc page. It's coming along really well. I created a simulated music player interface with four different techno tracks that rotate automatically, with play/pause controls and volume adjustment. It's currently just a mockup, but the interface looks good and captures the vibe.</p>

            <p>I also added a stream viewer section. It shows a grid of live streams with clickable thumbnails and mock viewer counts. Each stream has hover effects and when you click them, it shows alert popups with stream information. It's not connected to real streaming services yet, but the interface is there and looks good.</p>

            <p>The visual effects are probably the most fun part. I added multiple animated background layers - matrix rain with Japanese characters, floating data orbs, glitch blocks, bass drops, laser beams, strobe lights. There's even an animated audio visualizer with bouncing bars (though it's not responding to real audio yet). It really feels like an underground rave community now.</p>

            <p>I had to fix a bunch of mobile responsiveness issues too. The layout was breaking on smaller screens, so I added proper responsive breakpoints and fixed the button and image scaling. Now it works well on phones and tablets.</p>

            <p>The community integration is mostly placeholder right now. I added buttons that show alert popups for different community pages - Events, Community, Music, and Streams sections. The alerts show planned community features. It's a good foundation for when I implement the actual functionality.</p>

            <p>I also cleaned up a lot of technical issues. Fixed CSS syntax errors, added proper z-index layering for all the animations, and optimized performance by hiding overflow on containers. The page runs much smoother now.</p>

            <p>The whole thing really captures that underground rave and hacker culture vibe. It's perfect for showcasing our collective and the techno scene. Next step is to implement the actual community pages and integrate real streaming functionality, but the foundation is solid.</p>

            <div class="section-title">What's Next</div>
            <p>Next steps: Implement actual community pages and integrate real streaming functionality. But beyond that, I want to explore more cybersecurity research projects.</p>

            <p>I'm planning to dive deeper into:</p>
            <ul style="color: #eee; margin-left: 20px;">
                <li>Malware analysis and reverse engineering</li>
                <li>Network security and penetration testing</li>
                <li>Threat hunting and incident response</li>
                <li>Security tool development</li>
                <li>Community building in the cybersecurity space</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This blog will serve as a platform to share my research, document my projects, and hopefully connect with others in the cybersecurity community.</p>

            <div class="section-title">The Journey Begins</div>
            <p>You can find the Hackwave-Havoc Community page here: <a href="../hackwavehavoc/" style="color: #ff00ff;">Hackwave-Havoc</a></p>

            <p>This is just the beginning. I'm excited to share more about my projects, research, and thoughts on cybersecurity. Whether it's malware analysis, penetration testing, or building tools for the community, I'll be documenting it all here.</p>

            <p>Welcome to the journey. Let's explore the depths together.</p>
