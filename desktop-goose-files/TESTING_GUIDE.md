# Enhanced Desktop Goose - Testing Guide

## ðŸ§ª **Comprehensive Testing Strategy**

### **Phase 1: Configuration Testing**

#### **Test 1.1: Backward Compatibility**
```cmd
# Test with original config format
echo Version=0 > config.goos
echo CanAttackAtRandom=true >> config.goos
echo MinWanderingTimeSeconds=20 >> config.goos
echo MaxWanderingTimeSeconds=40 >> config.goos
echo FirstWanderTimeSeconds=20 >> config.goos

# Run the application
GooseDesktop.exe

# Expected Result: Should work exactly like original
# - Goose appears and moves around
# - No enhanced features activated
# - No errors or crashes
```

#### **Test 1.2: Enhanced Configuration**
```cmd
# Test with enhanced config format
# Use the provided config.goos with Version=0 and enhanced features

# Run the application
GooseDesktop.exe

# Expected Result: Should work with enhanced features
# - Goose appears and moves around
# - Enhanced features should be disabled by default (Version=0)
# - No errors or crashes
```

### **Phase 2: Compilation Testing**

#### **Test 2.1: Windows Native Compilation**
```cmd
# On Windows machine with Visual Studio Build Tools
msbuild GooseDesktop.sln /p:Configuration=Debug /verbosity:detailed

# Expected Result: Successful compilation
# - No compilation errors
# - Executable created in bin\Debug\
# - All required assemblies referenced
```

#### **Test 2.2: Dependency Validation**
```cmd
# Check for missing dependencies
# The following assemblies should be available:
# - System.Net
# - System.Net.Sockets
# - System.Diagnostics
# - Microsoft.Win32
# - System.Security.Cryptography
# - System.Text

# If any are missing, add to .csproj file
```

### **Phase 3: Runtime Testing**

#### **Test 3.1: Basic Functionality**
```cmd
# Test basic goose behavior
GooseDesktop.exe

# Expected Results:
# âœ… Goose appears on desktop
# âœ… Goose moves around naturally
# âœ… Mouse interaction works
# âœ… Original tasks work (wander, nab mouse, collect window, track mud)
# âœ… No crashes or errors
```

#### **Test 3.2: Enhanced Features (Disabled)**
```cmd
# Test with enhanced features disabled (Version=0)
# Expected Results:
# âœ… Enhanced features should not activate
# âœ… No file operations
# âœ… No network communication
# âœ… No system monitoring
# âœ… No registry access
# âœ… No process monitoring
```

#### **Test 3.3: Enhanced Features (Enabled)**
```cmd
# Test with enhanced features enabled
# Modify config.goos to enable features:
# EnableFileOperations=true
# EnableNetworkOperations=true
# EnableSystemInfoCollection=true
# EnableProcessMonitoring=true
# EnableRegistryAccess=true

# Expected Results:
# âœ… Enhanced tasks should appear in task rotation
# âœ… File operations should work (if directories exist)
# âœ… System monitoring should collect data
# âœ… Network communication should attempt connections
# âœ… Registry access should work (with proper permissions)
# âœ… Process monitoring should enumerate processes
```

### **Phase 4: Error Handling Testing**

#### **Test 4.1: Missing Dependencies**
```cmd
# Simulate missing dependencies
# Remove or rename some DLLs
# Run the application

# Expected Result:
# âœ… Application should start
# âœ… Enhanced features should fail gracefully
# âœ… Should fall back to original behavior
# âœ… No crashes
```

#### **Test 4.2: Network Failures**
```cmd
# Test network communication with invalid server
# Set RemoteServer=invalid.server.com
# Set RemotePort=9999

# Expected Result:
# âœ… Network communication should fail silently
# âœ… Should not crash the application
# âœ… Should continue with other tasks
```

#### **Test 4.3: File System Errors**
```cmd
# Test file operations with invalid paths
# Set TargetDirectories=C:\NonExistent\Path

# Expected Result:
# âœ… File operations should fail gracefully
# âœ… Should not crash the application
# âœ… Should continue with other tasks
```

#### **Test 4.4: Registry Access Errors**
```cmd
# Test registry access with invalid keys
# Or run without administrator privileges

# Expected Result:
# âœ… Registry access should fail gracefully
# âœ… Should not crash the application
# âœ… Should continue with other tasks
```

### **Phase 5: Data Collection Testing**

#### **Test 5.1: Data File Creation**
```cmd
# Run the application with enhanced features enabled
# Check for data file creation

# Expected Result:
# âœ… goose_data.txt should be created on desktop
# âœ… File should contain collected data
# âœ… Data should be properly formatted
```

#### **Test 5.2: Data Content Validation**
```cmd
# Examine the contents of goose_data.txt
# Should contain:
# - File operation data
# - System information
# - Network communication data
# - Registry access data
# - Process monitoring data
```

### **Phase 6: Stealth Testing**

#### **Test 6.1: Silent Operation**
```cmd
# Run the application
# Check Task Manager

# Expected Result:
# âœ… Should not show obvious signs of enhanced features
# âœ… Should appear as normal Desktop Goose
# âœ… No error dialogs or popups
```

#### **Test 6.2: Error Suppression**
```cmd
# Trigger various error conditions
# - Invalid network connections
# - File access denied
# - Registry access denied

# Expected Result:
# âœ… All errors should be handled silently
# âœ… No error messages to user
# âœ… Application continues running
```

## ðŸ”§ **Troubleshooting Guide**

### **Common Issues and Solutions**

#### **Issue 1: Compilation Errors**
```
Error: The reference assemblies for .NETFramework,Version=v4.0 were not found
Solution: Install .NET Framework 4.0 Developer Pack
```

#### **Issue 2: Missing Assemblies**
```
Error: Could not load file or assembly 'System.Net'
Solution: Add missing references to .csproj file
```

#### **Issue 3: Runtime Crashes**
```
Error: Application crashes on startup
Solution: Check for missing Assets folder or config.goos
```

#### **Issue 4: Enhanced Features Not Working**
```
Problem: Enhanced features don't activate
Solution: Check config.goos format and enable flags
```

#### **Issue 5: Data Collection Not Working**
```
Problem: No goose_data.txt file created
Solution: Check file permissions and DataCollector implementation
```
