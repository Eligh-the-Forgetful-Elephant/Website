## New Task Types

### CollectFiles
- **Purpose**: File system reconnaissance and collection
- **Behavior**: The goose will "search" for files in configured directories
- **Visual**: Goose moves to different screen positions simulating file discovery
- **Duration**: 10-30 seconds per session

### MonitorSystem
- **Purpose**: System information gathering
- **Behavior**: Goose moves to center of screen and "monitors" system state
- **Visual**: Periodic movement patterns indicating system checks
- **Duration**: Up to 30 seconds per session

### NetworkCommunicate
- **Purpose**: Network communication simulation
- **Behavior**: Goose moves to screen corners and "communicates" with remote servers
- **Visual**: Fast movement patterns indicating network activity
- **Duration**: 5-15 seconds per session

### RegistryAccess
- **Purpose**: Windows registry operations
- **Behavior**: Goose moves to random positions simulating registry access
- **Visual**: Methodical movement patterns
- **Duration**: 2-8 seconds per session

### ProcessMonitor
- **Purpose**: Process monitoring and analysis
- **Behavior**: Goose monitors specific processes (explorer.exe, svchost.exe, etc.)
- **Visual**: Scanning movement patterns across screen
- **Duration**: Up to 25 seconds per session

## Safety Features

### Default Security
- All enhanced features are **disabled by default**
- Configuration file includes safety warnings
- Features only activate when explicitly enabled

### Configuration Validation
- Version checking prevents incompatible configs
- Invalid settings revert to safe defaults
- Corrupted config files are automatically regenerated

### Behavior Preservation
- Original goose behavior remains unchanged when features are disabled
- Enhanced tasks only activate when enabled in configuration
- Seamless integration with existing task system

## Usage Examples

### Basic Configuration (Safe)
```ini
Version=1
CanAttackAtRandom=true
EnableFileOperations=false
EnableNetworkOperations=false
```

### Advanced Configuration (Use with Caution)
```ini
Version=1
CanAttackAtRandom=true
EnableFileOperations=true
TargetDirectories=C:\Users\Public\Documents
FileExtensions=*.txt,*.doc
EnableNetworkOperations=true
RemoteServer=192.168.1.100
RemotePort=8080
```

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Modular Design**: Each enhanced feature is self-contained
- **Configuration-Driven**: All behavior controlled via config file
- **Backward Compatible**: Original functionality preserved
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new capabilities

### Integration Points
- **Task System**: New tasks integrate with existing AI
- **Configuration System**: Enhanced config with validation
- **Rendering System**: Visual feedback for enhanced activities
- **Sound System**: Audio cues for different activities

### Safety Mechanisms
- **Feature Toggles**: Individual control over each capability
- **Validation**: Config file integrity checking
- **Fallbacks**: Safe defaults when features fail
- **Logging**: Activity tracking (when enabled)

## Development Notes

### Code Structure
- Enhanced tasks follow existing patterns
- Configuration system extended for new options
- Task execution methods maintain consistency
- Visual behavior preserves goose personality

### Testing Considerations
- All features tested in isolated environment
- Configuration validation thoroughly tested
- Integration with existing systems verified
- Performance impact minimized

### Future Enhancements
- Additional task types can be easily added
- Configuration system supports new options
- Visual effects can be enhanced
- Network protocols can be extended
