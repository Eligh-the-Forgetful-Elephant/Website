Hey all, I'm ezx or just EZ :slightly_smiling_face: hope you are all doing well! I live in upstate NY and work as a pentester for a consultancy called Coalfire. I played pvj first time in '23, played as co captain in '24, and excited to join you all for this year '25! We will certainly need to come up with a cool name for our team, please make suggestions :pirate_flag:
Another item is we should schedule a weekly meeting from now until the games begin. Perhaps we can agree on a time for all, maybe Sunday evenings? today might be a bit last minute. Let me know your thoughts and excited to meet you all soon :slightly_smiling_face:
1:17
We will do intros at our first meeting but feel free to drop anything about yourself in the meantime! I guess I can go first: I played a hard windows box on HTB yesterday called RustyKey, was a hard AD challenge, I might share some of my writeup later if anyone's interested. Also just got my hands on blade runner the theatrical cut w Harrison Ford's voiceover, never saw it before. Big fan of directors/final cuts :grin:

hello all - I'm outofmemory.  retired submarine officer, did a tour at NSA, then joined SAIC/Leidos.  If you say "crypto" around me I expect you either mean COMSEC or cryptographic analysis.
Been working as a tech lead and sometimes manager for 30+ years at this point.  Yes, I have a CISSP (and even worse a PMP) but please don't hold that against me.
I've gradually moved from "technical generalist focused on security" through "systems engineer" to now "solution architect" in the healthcare world.
I had some very limited red team/exploit work about 15-20 years ago but I've pretty much always been in defensive/policy roles.
Now we'll see whether I still have any mental agility - looking forward to learning and having a good time.

Hello, I am Shawn.  I have been doing IT work for some time now, I am currently assistant manager of IT for a small city in Alberta, Canada.  Having worked in the education sector for years I wear many hats.  I do network design, security, windows, Linux. Have my CCNA Cyberops and my CC from ISC2, currently working on my SSCP, and OSCP.  I do bug bounty hunting for fun, as well as HTB academy and try to keep up with the current seasons in HTB labs.  I have deployed and run security onion in a production environment across 16 sites and monitor anywhere from 10000 to 16000 endpoints online at any given time.

Here is some guidance on our team name from Luftegrof ```Please get team names set THIS WEEK.  We are going to incorporate them into the build so we no longer have to keep mapping them back and forth during the event. Give me a relatively short, Windows- & DNS-friendly name to represent your team. It will become your win domain name, your DNS domain, and more.``` (edited)

Hi y'all! I'm Brittney, I'm located and work out of the Twin Cities in Minnesota. Right now I work as a security engineer at a local bank, my primary focus is IAM and whatever my leadership needs to me to do. When it comes to CTF experience it is minimal, I've mostly only done MetaCTF, I am starting the Target Defense Challenge this week through WiCyS. I've been in IT in some capacity for about 6 years now. Looking forward to collaborating and hopefully learning something from everyone!

Hi everyone! I’m B4k3rY — a recent Cybersecurity Master’s graduate from Saint Louis University, currently planning to pursue a Ph.D. in cyber-physical systems security.
I’ve played in over 30 CTFs as the captain for SLU’s team, and I’m really passionate about both red teaming and defense. Right now, I’m working with a local cybersecurity startup called Ears Up Cyber Security, helping them build hands-on red vs blue training environments for students and professionals.
I know many of you bring amazing experience to the table, and I’m genuinely excited to learn from all of you throughout this event. Here’s my portfolio https://syam-sai-siddabhattula-github-io.vercel.app/ if you’d like to know a bit more about my background and projects.
Looking forward to a great CTF — and some fun battles ahead!

Hi, I’m Oscar and I’m currently in Los Angeles working at Riot Games as a Security Engineer. My relevant experiences are about 9+ years of cybersecurity work ranging from insider threat to security operations analyst and red team analyst. I started out in very focused roles at a major bank to a startup and now doing a little bit of everything security operations related. I used to do a lot of HTB when I was aiming to be a red teamer and I hosted learning sessions for the soc to walk through each challenge but have stepped away from offensive security for a bit now. I participated in several cyber range exercises in which I’ve nmap scanned an attacker’s machine once and pulled down all the exploits they were hosting. Another instance, I’ve basically baselined the entire network activity on day one and disrupted every attempt to have a beacon on a machine (although it wasnt too difficult since they were all direct IP connections so it was very noticeable)
More recently I’ve mainly been building and maintaining security tools for operation. This is my first time doing pvj, excited to meet and learn from everyone!

Okay, so self-assessment time IMHO:  I started hacking on IBM mainframes and Sun 68k (SunOS 4.x) boxes in the 80s but I won't claim any l33t skills - it was easy back then.  For a little while in $dayjob ~2002 I put together and supported a "petting zoo" of vulnerable boxes as part of our "so you want to be a pen-tester" course.  This was in the latter days of HP-UX 10.20, IRIX 6.2, Win NT4/Win98, etc. - so low barrier to entry, but we only gave the students access to a limited Linux image with selected exploits that were tested/working/not malware and they had to sort that.  (yes, I'm so freaking old this was before Kali)
If they were tall enough to ride the roller coaster, then I got to give them the Rules of Engagement brief as this was for commercial hired pentesting.
I have some comprehension and even deeper understanding of AD/Windows stuff (particularly on the DNS/Kerberos piece), but in terms of "where can I be most useful" it's probably on the Linux blue-team side.  I've been using Slackware, then Debian, then mostly Ubuntu since 1997.  At the same time, I haven't been in a role where I needed to directly hack or prevent hacking with hands-on-keyboard since...aw shit maybe 2005?
Some impostor syndrome, but I'm pretty sure that's a goal of PvJ - several of y'all are likely to be much more useful than me but I'll try to do my part.

John Hammond recorded his screen when he participated in Pros Versus Joes and shared this video which shows that footage, sped up. It's cool to see the actual game play, including the proxmox interface, slack communications, keeping tabs on the scoreboard, the crazy amount of terminals he has open and the research he's doing in the middle of it all. It's good inspiration for planning the sorts of things you'd like to do for the CTF. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg00YX1tYIM

The pfsense box is a custom version. They’re going to do a lot to stop you from updating/upgrading. I’m going to ask a past teammate about it rn and get details

Is it like just "pre-configured", or "heavily modified", meaning they accessed the CLI and changed config from the CLI? (which is something you shouldn't do if you follow pfsense documentation) (edited)

Re: Voucher codes - I got one from ezx but can't figure out where/how to use it.  I had already dropped $100 for B-sides so if I can gift that ticket to a friend I'd love to but I won't do that unless I can actually use the voucher code.  Did I miss a link to a particular eventbrite page?  (there's nowhere obvious to use it on the B-sides page which also implies the main event is sold out unsurprisingly.)
Has anyone been able to use their $25 voucher code?

New topic:  Do we need an icon/emoji/pic for Scorebot?
It looks as though most previous teams have had some image (often a meme) to make it easier to identify the column in Scorebot displays.  I'm not that creative but since I am the one who suggested B4FFL3G4P I came up with the attached based on the first related thing that came to mind (London Underground).
I consider it only a suggestion/placeholder until we have a better one.  Comments welcomed.

@here VPN credentials have been sent to your email.
Please note the following IMPORTANT things!!!
If you are using Windows OS, you need to install OpenVPN client v2.5.4. The newer clients DO NOT work!
The email is coming from noreply@prosversusjoes.net, don't forget to check your spam folder.
Test out your VPN access and make sure it works so that you don't have to spend GAME TIME doing this!
Team Captain! If your user is on the spreadsheet, not highlighted in yellow and did NOT receive VPN creds, please ping me.

I strongly suggest meeting even if only once before we start
I think several of us are in Vegas already with others landing tonight or tomorrow AM??
If we want to meet today just let me know- I’d suggest online vice in person (I’m at the Venetian so it will take me 20+ minutes to walk to Tuscany).
I also plan to at registration by 8 AM so I’ll look forward to seeing folks in the room where it happens.

FOR REVIEW: WUZAH XDR PROPOSAL
Hello all,
Greywater Beverages is requesting bids for another project to address security concerns with our hosted environments. We need to get Wuzah XDR (https://wazuh.com/platform/xdr/) deployed and configured ASAP since we can't afford Crowdstrike or their competitors.

@ELEPHANTSFORG3T Based on the going market rates & our own available budget (we can't cut into the golf outings) I don't think we'll be able to offer that much.

eth5 (Grey Team Captain)

Congratulations IT Security team your bid has been accepted for 30K JoeCoin!
Please ensure that Wuzah XDR agents are deployed on all supported hosts in your environment.
Additionally we will need to see at least (1) custom Windows policy & (1) custom Linux policy.
This project will be open until 1:06PM EST.
Please let us know when you have completed the work & we will come by to review!

As agreed, we are restarting the clock.
The project requirements are as followed:
Deploy Wuzah XDR agents on all supported scored hosts
Configure custom prevention policies
(1) for Windows
(1) for Linux
Brief executive summary explaining the policies you created & what they're meant to prevent (can be either bullet points or you can just tell us verbally)
