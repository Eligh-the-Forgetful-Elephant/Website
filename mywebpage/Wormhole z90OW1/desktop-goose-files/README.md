## Project Overview

The Enhanced Desktop Goose is a modified version of the original Desktop Goose application, designed for malware research and cybersecurity education. It maintains the playful nature of the original while adding real functionality for system analysis and data collection.

### Enhanced Features

- **File Operations**: Scan directories, collect file information, and analyze file structures
- **System Monitoring**: Gather OS information, machine details, memory usage, and system statistics
- **Network Communication**: Establish TCP connections and send data to remote servers
- **Registry Access**: Enumerate and read Windows registry keys and values
- **Process Monitoring**: Check for running processes and services
- **Data Collection**: Centralized logging and export of all collected information

### Safety Features

- **Backward Compatibility**: Works exactly like the original if enhanced features are disabled
- **Silent Error Handling**: Fails gracefully without crashing or revealing enhanced functionality
- **Configuration Control**: All enhanced features can be enabled/disabled via config file
- **Stealth Operation**: Maintains the appearance of a normal desktop pet

## Quick Start

1. **Download Files**: Get the essential files from the web interface
2. **Compile on Windows**: Use the provided batch script or follow the compilation guide
3. **Configure Settings**: Edit `config.goos` to enable desired features
4. **Run Application**: Execute the compiled `GooseDesktop.exe`

## Documentation

- **PRACTICAL_USAGE.md**: Complete guide for using enhanced features
- **COMPILATION_GUIDE.md**: Step-by-step compilation instructions
- **ENHANCED_FEATURES.md**: Technical documentation of new capabilities
- **TESTING_GUIDE.md**: Comprehensive testing strategy and validation
- **VALIDATION_STRATEGY.md**: Critical issues and validation approach
- **FIX_STRATEGY.md**: Problem resolution and troubleshooting

## Technical Requirements

- **Platform**: Windows (Windows Forms application)
- **Framework**: .NET Framework 4.0
- **Language**: C#
- **Build Tools**: Visual Studio or MSBuild

## Configuration

The `config.goos` file controls all enhanced features:

```ini
# Enhanced capabilities (set to true for research)
EnableFileOperations=true
EnableNetworkOperations=true
EnableSystemInfoCollection=true
EnableProcessMonitoring=true
EnableRegistryAccess=true

# File operation settings
TargetDirectories=C:\Users\Public\Documents,C:\Users\Public\Desktop
FileExtensions=*.txt,*.doc,*.pdf,*.xlsx
RecursiveFileSearch=false
MaxFileSizeKB=1024

# Network settings
RemoteServer=
RemotePort=8080
UseEncryption=false
EncryptionKey=

# System monitoring settings
MonitorProcesses=false
MonitorServices=false
MonitorRegistry=false
MonitoringIntervalSeconds=30
```

## Data Collection

The enhanced goose creates a `goose_data.txt` file on the desktop containing:
- File paths and information
- System details and statistics
- Network connection attempts
- Registry data
- Process monitoring results
