## When to Use These Files

### Use Essential Toolkit First
The files in `../essential_toolkit/` are your **primary tools** because they:
- Work on any Windows/Linux system
- Have no external dependencies
- Are specifically designed for ThunderStorm
- Are simple and reliable

### Use Backup Alternatives If:
1. **Essential tools don't work** on your specific system
2. **You need additional functionality** not in the main tools
3. **You have Python available** and prefer cross-platform tools
4. **You need more detailed guidance** for specific scenarios
5. **You want alternative approaches** to try

## Recommendation
**Start with the essential toolkit** (`../essential_toolkit/`). Only use these backup alternatives if you encounter problems or need additional capabilities.

The essential toolkit is designed to give you the maximum advantage with minimum complexity. These backups are there "just in case."
